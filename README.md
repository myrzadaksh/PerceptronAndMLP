Perceptron and MultiPerceptron Implementation

Overview

This project implements the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification and extends it to the MultiPerceptron for multiclass classification. Written in Java, this project demonstrates the foundational principles of machine learning with easy-to-follow code and examples.


Features

ðŸ§  Perceptron:

- Binary Classification, Classifies inputs into two categories (1 or -1).

- Adjustable Weights: Learns by adjusting weights based on misclassified inputs.

- Simple and Lightweight: Suitable for linear classification tasks.

ðŸ”— MultiPerceptron:

- Multiclass Classification: Handles multiple classes using a "one-vs-all" approach.

- Modular Design: Built using multiple single-layer perceptrons.

- Flexible: Can predict the class with the highest confidence.


Technologies Used:

- Java: Object-oriented programming language.

- Core Programming Concepts: Classes, methods, loops, and arrays.


How It Works:

1)Perceptron:

- Initialization: Define the number of inputs and initialize the weights.

- Training: Update weights if the predicted output differs from the expected output.

- Prediction: Compute the weighted sum of inputs and classify as 1 or -1.

2)MultiPerceptron:

- Initialization: Create multiple Perceptrons (one for each class).

- Training: Train each Perceptron to recognize its class versus all others.

- Prediction: Select the class with the highest weighted sum.


Learning Outcomes:
  
- Understand the Perceptron algorithm and its applications in binary classification.
  
- Learn how to extend the Perceptron for multiclass classification using a modular approach.
  
- Practice Java programming with a focus on machine learning concepts.

  
Future Enhancements:

- Add learning rate for more refined weight adjustments.
  
- Extend to handle non-linear problems using activation functions.
  
- Implement visualization tools to display decision boundaries.
